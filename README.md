# KataChat
my proposal for "Social Networking Kata" to run under Linux Ubuntu OS

# Building instructions
- donwload and install Qt Community edition for Linux Ubuntu OS (online is at: https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
- follow the installation wizard
- signup to create your personal account at www.qt.io (the installer wizard will propmt you for it and guide you through the process)
- you will only need to select "Developer and Designer Tools" and the latest Qt library version (Qt 5.15.0 as of writing, any version Qt 5.x.y will do fine)
- Clone this GitHub repository to your local folder
- Launch QtCreator IDE
- Select "Projects > Open" and navigate to open the MyKata.pro file in your local folder
- accept default settings for build environment
- Inspect code, Build, Run (CTRL+F5: it will launch the debug build; you can always switch to release build)

Enjoy (hopefully).
